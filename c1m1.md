# Course 1 Module 1: Introduction to Deep Learning
# 6 April 2018

# Welcome
AI is the new electricty!
1. Neural nets and DL
2. Hyperparameter tuning, regularization, optimization
3. Structuring your ML project
4. CNNs
5. NLP and sequence models: RNN, 

# What is a Neural Network
Linear regression with 0 dropout is simplest NN
Going from house size to house price

ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function makes negative values 0
Simples NN has one ReLU node
Stacking many neurons together gives a more complex NN

Intermediate nodes should represent some tangible combinations of factors
x may be size, #bedrooms, zip code, wealth
intermediate may be family size, walkability, school quality
y may be house price
Intermediate nodes (hidden units) take all previous layer stuff as features
Densely connected layers are layers that are entirely connected

Given enough x and y data, NN are good are figuring out weights for dense connections

# Supervised Learning with Neural Networks
Supervised learning is by far the most important kind of learning
Supervised learning is where you go from input x to output y
Real estate is house features to price
Online advertising is from ad, user info to click on ad or not?
Photo tagging is image to object
Speech recognition is audio to text transcript
Machine translation is from language to language
CV is image to positions of other objects

Language translation is done with RNN
Standard NN, convolution NN, Recurrent NN are the most common

Structured data is when you have a database of data

Unstructured data is setuff like audio, images, and text
Features are words and pixel values; harder to make sense of unstructured data

# why is Deep Learning Taking Off?
Traditiona learning methods don't get much better with more and more data
Lowercase m denotes the size of the training set
Samll training sets: NNs are not really the best
ReLU makes gradient descent much faster than sigmoid function
